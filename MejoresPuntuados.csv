8869;Argentina;If you love massive Argentine reds with purity of fruit and fine oak, then this blend is up your alley. Toasty blackberry aromas come with plenty of oak grain, vanilla and depth. This is profoundly deep on the palate, while toasty blackberry, chocolate and peppery flavors finish with mocha and bracing tannins that aren't too rocky or hard. Drink through 2025.;Finca Pedregal Single Vineyard Barrancas Maipú Selected Lots;95;74.0;Mendoza Province;Mendoza;;Michael Schachner;@wineschach;Pascual Toso 2014 Finca Pedregal Single Vineyard Barrancas Maipú Selected Lots Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec (Mendoza);Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec;Pascual Toso;América;0.08;68.08
6673;India;The nose carries notes of cassis, blackberry and bell pepper. An approachable, yet complex wine, the palate shows flavors of black cherry, bacon, black pepper, vanilla and espresso bean. Rich tannins linger without burdening the taste buds. Pleasant notes of smoke and salt linger on the finish.;Dindori Reserve;93;20.0;Nashik;;;Mike DeSimone;@worldwineguys;Sula 2011 Dindori Reserve Shiraz (Nashik);Shiraz;Sula;Asia;0.1;18.0
345;Australia;This wine contains some material over 100 years old, but shows no signs of fragility. Instead, it's concentrated through age and should hold in the bottle indefinitely. It's dark coffee-brown in color, with delectable aromas of rancio, dried fig, molasses and black tea, yet despite enormous concentration avoids excessive weight. And it's amazingly complex and fresh on the nearly endless finish.;Rare;100;350.0;Victoria;Rutherglen;;Joe Czerwinski;@JoeCz;Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Rare Muscat (Rutherglen);Muscat;Chambers Rosewood Vineyards;Australia y Oceanía;;
42197;Portugal;This is the latest release of what has long been regarded as Portugal's iconic wine. And it is magnificent. The last vintage was the 2004 and the wait has now shown to be worthwhile. With its immense span and breadth of flavors and rich structure it is a superb manifestation of the great vineyards of the Douro Superior. Big bold fruits and acidity are matched by the tannins and concentration. Hold this for many years or at least wait until 2022.;Barca-Velha;100;450.0;Douro;;;Roger Voss;@vossroger;Casa Ferreirinha 2008 Barca-Velha Red (Douro);Portuguese Red;Casa Ferreirinha;Europa;0.09;409.5
